/*
containers

std::vector, an array-based sequence, in the same spirit as the ArrayList class we wrote in a previous example
std::list, a doubly-linked list with head and tail pointers
std::map, a balanced binary search tree of key/value pairs

these containers are 
type-generic
class templates
well-behaved

std::vector stores a sequence of objects

A vector must have been created with a particular number of cells.
A vector use array cells, so each element has an index.
Accessing an element is O(1)
Inserting elements at beginning of the sequence, removing elements from the middle of the sequence, and so on, are O(N)
